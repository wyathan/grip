
- You just added send ContextFile requests for transfers to connected nodes.
    - You need to add a Pending list so we don't re-request files we've already asked for.

- Check accounts for locally created ContextFiles
- Add file transfers
    - Create file transfers for all new accepting ContextResponses
        - If full repo create file transfers for all files.
        - Otherwise we might be able to just send the top files down to the latest snapshot.
            - Only a node with a full repo could do this though.
    - Add connection to connection file transfer (bonus)
- Test context file caching 
- Test file transfers 
- Finish IncomingFileTransfer in file_transfer_network_functions.go

- When saving ContextFileTransferWrap the database function should check for an existing
    ContextFileWrap that matches and point the transfer to it.  This should be done as part
    of the save transaction 
- When saving ContextFile to database it should automatically add link to 
    existing ContextFileTransferWraps that match
    - When receiving incoming ContextFile check if matching DeletedContextFile exists
        don't save it to the regular ContextFiles if so.
    - Add to existing matching ContextFileTrasnfers 
- Connect to nodes we have ContextFileTransfers for
- Do not add DeletedContextFile to the objects returned from GetDigestData
